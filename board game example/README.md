## Gomoku & Connect Four Examplary STM32 app and Their Terminal Debugger

**Core idea:** minimax with alpha-beta pruning, where Gomoku includes an optimization to try only cells near occupied cells

**How to use:**
Gomoku: input a column (letter A to O, case insensitive) and then a row (01 to 15, # of digits insensitive) OR enter them together
        e.g. h8 as center (standard start);
Connect Four: enter 1 to 7.
